# Coding Exercise

This repo includes my coding exercise with the following pages:

* Index.html
* Results.html

`Index.html` lets you search for Artists via a search box entry. It displays artist info as tiles which can be further clicked to view specific events.

## How to run tests

Jest has been added as a dev dependency to test methods. Follow these steps to run tests:

* Clone repo
* Run `npm i`
* Run `npm run test -- --watchAll`
